# **DownscaleX: A Comparative Framework for Weather Downscaling**  

### **📌 Overview**  
DownscaleX is a modular framework for comparing different **weather downscaling techniques**, including:  
- **Dynamical Downscaling** (NCUM-R)  
- **Statistical Downscaling**  
- **Deep Learning-Based Downscaling** (DL4DS)  

The goal is to evaluate and improve the accuracy of downscaling methods for better **high-resolution weather predictions**.
